Each git repository, comes with 'main' branch as default.

What is commit ?
Commit -> represents a set of changes (delta), from previous state (commit).
Change can be : added file(s) / edited file(s) / delete file(s)

What is branch ?

All commits, are related to a certain 'branch'
Branch allows to keep separation, between different commits.

Commands
--------

To know which branch are you currently at:
git status / git branch

Commits
-------

Commit, represents a change, compared to last state.

To commit locally into the current branch:
git commit
You will type a commit message, that should describe what has been comitted.

git push -> pushes the local commited change, into the remote repository (github)

Typing:
git status, allows us to see all pending changes to a commit, or
changes that haven't been added to a commit yet.

GitIgnore
---------

In the root project directory, you can create .gitignore
All files / directories specified there -> will be ignored in adding to commits
This specifically, you need to force add.
git add -f .gitignore

Branches
--------

Branch, allow to retain specific development.
For example: Me and amos are working on test_field git repository together
Each of us, have their own 'branches', this allow amos and I , to develop
without rewriting eachother

Creating a new branch:
git checkout -b alon/new_feature
In this specific point, the new branch will 'branch out' of the current branch.

To change branches locally:
git checkout <branch_name>

Pull Request
------------

This is a github feature, that allows to inspect changed code for a branch,
before we merge it.

Merge
-----

Alon has started to develop a new feature, branched out of 'main' branch
He finished. This branch, needs to be merged into main.
