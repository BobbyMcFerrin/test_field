Each git repository, comes with 'main' branch as default.

What is commit ?
Commit -> represents a set of changes (delta), from previous state (commit).
Change can be : added file(s) / edited file(s) / delete file(s)

What is branch ?

All commits, are related to a certain 'branch'
Branch allows to keep separation, between different commits.

Commands
--------

To know which branch are you currently at:
git status / git branch

Commits
-------

Commit, represents a change, compared to last state.

To commit locally into the current branch:
git commit
You will type a commit message, that should describe what has been comitted.

git push -> pushes the local commited change, into the remote repository (github)

Typing:
git status, allows us to see all pending changes to a commit, or
changes that haven't been added to a commit yet.

GitIgnore
---------

In the root project directory, you can create .gitignore
All files / directories specified there -> will be ignored in adding to commits
This specifically, you need to force add.
git add -f .gitignore
